#  SkillBridge

SkillBridge is a platform that connects service providers with users looking for their skills ‚Äî from tutoring to tech support. Providers can submit their services, and users can browse, book, and manage appointments, all without accessing the admin panel.

##  Project Overview

SkillBridge allows registered users to either:

- Offer a service (e.g. tutoring, design)
- Or request services by browsing, filtering, and booking

Admins approve submitted services before they go public.

## Features

Custom Model: `SkillService` and `BookingRequest`  
Service submission form (CRUD for providers)  
Booking request form (CRUD for users)  
Frontend delete/edit buttons for user records  
Admin approval system  
Filter services by title and category  
Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
User registration, login, logout  
Custom 404 page  
Testing with Django + validation tools

## How to Use the Website

### For New Users:
1. Click on **"Sign Up"** to create a new account.
2. Log in using your credentials.
3. As a regular user, you can:
   - Browse approved services.
   - Use filters to find services by category or keyword.
   - View service details and submit a **booking request**.
   - Manage your bookings from the **dashboard**.

### For Providers:
1. After signing up and logging in:
   - Go to **"Submit a Service"** to offer a new service.
   - Fill out the form with title, description, category, rate, and availability.
   - Wait for admin approval (you‚Äôll see it in the dashboard once approved).
   - Edit or delete services directly from the dashboard.
   - View and manage incoming **booking requests**.

### Admin Functionality:
- Admin can log into the Django admin panel.
- Review submitted services and approve or reject them.
- Only **approved** services are shown to public users.

### Device Compatibility:
- The site is responsive and works on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Django  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 
- JavaScript (JSHint-tested)  
- Bootstrap  
- SQLite (can be configured)  
- Git & GitHub  


## üìÖ Agile Process

- GitHub Projects board used to manage tasks and user stories  
- Clear milestones and labels applied  
- User stories written from user perspective (e.g. "As a provider, I want to...")  
- All commits follow small, meaningful messages.

### üîß Manual Testing

We tested the following features manually to ensure they work as expected:

- Registering and logging in/out as a user or provider  
- Submitting services and viewing the provider dashboard  
- Booking a service as a user  
- Canceling bookings from the dashboard  
- Editing and deleting services  
- Admin approval system for submitted services  
- Custom 404 page display  
- Responsive layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices  

### Automated Testing

We used Django's `TestCase` to verify key functionality:

- Service submission requires login  
- Dashboard renders correctly  
- Booking form processes correctly  

To run the tests:
python manage.py test 

### Errors and Bugs We Overcame

Throughout the project, we encountered some issues and fixed them. Here are some examples:

-  **Booking form not saving**  
  - The test failed because the booking form required a field named `message`, but the form used `messages`.  
  -  *Fix:* Corrected the field name in the form and test.

- **Django test failure: 0 != 1**  
  - A test was expecting one booking to be saved, but none was.  
  -*Fix:* Ensured the booking form was valid and that the user was logged in.

-  **ImportError for a view not found**  
  - Tried to import `delete_service` from `views.py`, but the function was either missing or renamed.  
  -*Fix:* Added or renamed the view to match the import correctly.

-  **W3C HTML validator showing errors**  
  - Validator showed errors due to Django template syntax (`{% %}`), which is not valid HTML.  
  - *Fix:* Confirmed that the final rendered HTML (using ‚ÄúView Page Source‚Äù) is valid and passes W3C checks.

- **Responsive layout not working well on all devices**  
  - Some sections didn‚Äôt look right on mobile or tablets.  
  - *Fix:* Added media queries to adjust layout for different screen sizes.

These issues were fixed with careful testing and debugging during development.

üßπ Validation Tools

- **W3C CSS Validator**: No errors found  
- **JSHint**: JavaScript passes with no major issues  
- **W3C HTML Validator**:  
  - Shows template errors due to Django `{% %}` syntax  
  - Rendered HTML (using browser "View Source") is valid and passes W3C checks
