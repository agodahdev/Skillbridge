  #  SkillBridge

  SkillBridge is a platform that connects service providers with users looking for their skills ‚Äî from tutoring to tech support. Providers can submit their services, and users can browse, book, and manage appointments, all without accessing the admin panel.

  ##  Project Overview

  SkillBridge allows registered users to either:

  - Offer a service (e.g. tutoring, design)
  - Or request services by browsing, filtering, and booking

  Admins approve submitted services before they go public.

  ## Features

  Custom Model: `SkillService` and `BookingRequest`  
  Service submission form (CRUD for providers)  
  Booking request form (CRUD for users)  
  Frontend delete/edit buttons for user records  
  Admin approval system  
  Filter services by title and category  
  Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
  User registration, login, logout  
  Custom 404 page  
  Testing with Django + validation tools

  2. Log in using your credentials.
  3. As a regular user, you can:
    - Browse approved services.
    - Use filters to find services by category or keyword.
    - View service details and submit a **booking request**.
    - Manage your bookings from the **dashboard**.

  ### For Providers:
  1. After signing up and logging in:
    - Go to **"Submit a Service"** to offer a new service.
    - Fill out the form with title, description, category, rate, and availability.
    - Wait for admin approval (you‚Äôll see it in the dashboard once approved).
    - Edit or delete services directly from the dashboard.
    - View and manage incoming **booking requests**.

  ### Admin Functionality:
  - Admin can log into the Django admin panel.
  - Review submitted services and approve or reject them.

### Model Relationships

**User ‚Üí SkillService (One-to-Many)**
- One user (provider) can create multiple services
- Field: `SkillService.provider` (ForeignKey to User)
- Delete behavior: CASCADE (if user deleted, their services are deleted)

**User ‚Üí BookingRequest (One-to-Many)**
- One user (client) can make multiple booking requests
- Field: `BookingRequest.client` (ForeignKey to User)
- Delete behavior: CASCADE (if user deleted, their bookings are deleted)

**SkillService ‚Üí BookingRequest (One-to-Many)**
- One service can have multiple booking requests
- Field: `BookingRequest.service` (ForeignKey to SkillService)
- Delete behavior: CASCADE (if service deleted, bookings are deleted)

### Model Details

#### SkillService Model
**Purpose:** Stores service offerings from providers

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | Primary Key | Auto-generated unique identifier |
| `title` | CharField(100) | Service name/title |
| `description` | TextField | Detailed service description |
| `category` | CharField(50) | Service category (choices from predefined list) |
| `rate_per_hour` | DecimalField(6,2) | Price per hour |
| `provider` | ForeignKey(User) | User who created the service |
| `is_approved` | BooleanField | Admin approval status (default: False) |
| `created_at` | DateTimeField | Timestamp of creation (auto_now_add) |

**Business Rules:**
- Services are hidden from public until `is_approved=True`
- Only the provider can edit/delete their services
- Admin can approve/reject via Django admin panel

---

#### BookingRequest Model
**Purpose:** Stores client booking requests for services

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | Primary Key | Auto-generated unique identifier |
| `service` | ForeignKey(SkillService) | The service being booked |
| `client` | ForeignKey(User) | User making the booking |
| `requested_date` | DateField | Requested service date |
| `messages` | TextField | Message/details from client |
| `status` | CharField(10) | Booking status (default: 'Pending') |
| `created_at` | DateTimeField | Timestamp of booking creation (auto_now_add) |

**Business Rules:**
- Clients must be authenticated to create bookings
- Status defaults to "Pending"
- Both client and provider can cancel bookings
- Bookings appear in provider's dashboard

---

### Category Choices
Services can be categorized into:
- **Tutoring:** Educational services
- **Tech Help:** Technical assistance and IT support
- **Sewing:** Clothing alterations and repairs
- **Gardening:** Garden maintenance and landscaping
- **Other:** Any other service type

---

### Status Choices
Booking requests can have these statuses:
- **pending:** Awaiting provider response (default)
- **accepted:** Provider has accepted the booking
- **rejected:** Provider has declined the booking

---

### Data Integrity
- All foreign keys use `on_delete=CASCADE` to maintain referential integrity
- User deletion cascades to their services and bookings
- Service deletion cascades to associated bookings
- Database constraints ensure required fields are populated
- `auto_now_add=True` automatically sets timestamps on creation


  ## Agile Process

  - GitHub Projects board used to manage tasks and user stories  
  - Clear milestones and labels applied  
  - User stories written from user perspective (e.g. "As a provider, I want to...")  
  - All commits follow small, meaningful messages.

  ### Manual Testing

  We tested the following features manually to ensure they work as expected:

  - Registering and logging in/out as a user or provider  
  - Submitting services and viewing the provider dashboard  
  - Booking a service as a user  
  - Canceling bookings from the dashboard  
  - Editing and deleting services  
  - Admin approval system for submitted services  
  - Custom 404 page display  
  - Responsive layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices  
  ### Automated Testing

  We used Django's `TestCase` to verify key functionality:

  - Service submission requires login  
  - Dashboard renders correctly  
  - Booking form processes correctly  

  To run the tests:
  python manage.py test 

  ### Errors and Bugs We Overcame

  Throughout the project, we encountered some issues and fixed them. Here are some examples:

  -  **Booking form not saving**  
    - The test failed because the booking form required a field named `message`, but the form used `messages`.  
    -  *Fix:* Corrected the field name in the form and test.

  - **Django test failure: 0 != 1**  
    - A test was expecting one booking to be saved, but none was.  
    -*Fix:* Ensured the booking form was valid and that the user was logged in.

  -  **ImportError for a view not found**  
    - Tried to import `delete_service` from `views.py`, but the function was either missing or renamed.  
    -*Fix:* Added or renamed the view to match the import correctly.

  -  **W3C HTML validator showing errors**  
    - Validator showed errors due to Django template syntax (`{% %}`), which is not valid HTML.  
    - *Fix:* Confirmed that the final rendered HTML (using ‚ÄúView Page Source‚Äù) is valid and passes W3C checks.

  - **Responsive layout not working well on all devices**  
    - Some sections didn‚Äôt look right on mobile or tablets.  
    - *Fix:* Added media queries to adjust layout for different screen sizes.

  These issues were fixed with careful testing and debugging during development.

 ## Validation Tools

  - **W3C CSS Validator**: No errors found  
  - **JSHint**: JavaScript passes with no major issues  
  - **W3C HTML Validator**:  
    - Shows template errors due to Django `{% %}` syntax  
    - Rendered HTML (using browser "View Source") is valid and passes W3C checks  

  
 ## Security & Configuration

 ### Environment Variables

 This project uses environment variables to keep sensitive information secure. All secrets are stored outside the codebase.

 **Required environment variables:**
 - `SECRET_KEY` - Django secret key for cryptographic signing
 - `DEBUG` - Debug mode (True for development, False for production)
 - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Comma-separated list of allowed host/domain names

 ### Local Development Setup

 1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
 SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
 DEBUG=True
 ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1


 2. Never commit the `.env` file to Git (it's protected by `.gitignore`)

 ### Production Deployment (Heroku)

 Environment variables are set using Heroku config vars:
 heroku config:set SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
 heroku config:set DEBUG=False
 heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS='your-app.herokuapp.com'


 ## üîê Security Features & Rationale

### Environment Variables
**What:** Store SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, and ALLOWED_HOSTS in `.env` file (local) and Heroku config vars (production).

**Why:** 
- Keeps secrets out of GitHub where anyone can see them
- Allows different settings for local testing vs. live site
- If SECRET_KEY is exposed, hackers can access user sessions

**How:** Used `python-decouple` library, `.env` protected by `.gitignore`

---

### DEBUG Mode Off in Production
**What:** DEBUG=True locally, DEBUG=False on Heroku

**Why:**
- DEBUG=True shows detailed error messages with file paths and settings
- Hackers can use this information to find weaknesses
- Users should only see friendly error messages

**How:** Set via environment variables (different for local vs. Heroku)

---

### Login Required
**What:** Users must log in to submit services, book services, and access dashboard

**Why:**
- Stops spam and fake submissions
- Makes users accountable for their actions
- Protects against bots

**Protected pages:** Submit service, book service, edit/delete, dashboard

---

### Owner-Only Access
**What:** Users can only edit/delete their own services and bookings

**Why:**
- Stops users from deleting others' services
- Prevents sabotage and data tampering
- Builds trust in the platform

**How:** Check if `request.user == service.provider` in views

---

### CSRF Protection
**What:** All forms have `{% csrf_token %}`

**Why:**
- Stops attackers from tricking users into unwanted actions
- Ensures forms are submitted from our website, not fake sites
- Django validates the token automatically

---

### Admin Approval
**What:** Services need admin approval before showing publicly

**Why:**
- Prevents spam and scam services
- Maintains quality and trust
- Protects clients from fake listings

**How:** `is_approved` field (default: False), only show approved services

---

### Input Validation
**What:** All forms validated using Django forms

**Why:**
- Stops bad data from breaking the site
- Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Ensures data is formatted correctly

**Checks:** Required fields, max lengths, valid dates, valid prices

---

### Password Security
**What:** Django's built-in password hashing

**Why:**
- Passwords never stored as plain text
- If database is stolen, passwords are still safe
- Uses industry-standard encryption

---

### Future Improvements
- Rate limiting (stop spam submissions)
- Email verification for new accounts
- Two-factor authentication
- Password reset functionality
